# We do: 
Analyze myDNA was one of the projects at the Summer School of Science (S3++) camp in 2019 [Link to projects](https://drustvo-evo.hr/s3/s3pp_2019.html). 

The main goal of the project was to make open source programme that analyzes the human genome - [myDNA](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNAS). myDNA R package that was developed as a part of the project provides information about genetic susceptibility to diseases and traits of interest. Programme is made in R programming language which is commonly used for research in genomics, biology, statistics and data analysis.
In addition, we started this blog [myDNA blog](https://juliaht.github.io/myDNA/) and developed minimal shiny app [myDNA_shinyApp](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNA_shinyApp).

# What is the Summer School of Science?

The story of the Summer School of Science started in 2001. In a small village Visnjan, in Istra in Croatia, a group of enthusiastic science educators founded this school. In 2010, the Summer School of Science expanded to Požega. This School has an entirely international character and so far has hosted more than 300 students from Croatia, Germany, France, Spain, Turkey, Lithuania, USA, Sri Lanka, and many other countries. The Summer School of Science is an educational scientific program targeted at highly motivated high school students. The main goal of the School is to give students an opportunity to work on real scientific projects and promote career ways related to the natural sciences. The School is divided into two camps(S3 and S3++) that take place in July and August each year. Around 50 students work in small groups of three or four people supervised by a mentor who is usually a PhD student or a postdoctoral researcher.
