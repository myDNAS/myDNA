#  Where? 
We started here: 
In Pozega, in 2017, at summer school of science: https://drustvo-evo.hr/s3/s3pp_2017.html

# Who?
We were a group of 4 students supervised by Inga
Lovro Rabuzin from V. gymnasium, Klaićeva 1, 10000 Zagreb
Réka Gyetvai from Bela III Secondary School, 6500 Baja, Szent Imre tér 5., Hungary
Julia Hamblin-Trué from IB Programme at the Berlin International School, Lentzeallee 8/14, 14195 Berlin, Germany
Lukas Lorenz G11 from Geringergasse 2, 1110 Vienna, Austria
Inga Patarčić from Berlin Institute for Molecular Systems Biology at Max-Delbrück-Centre for Molecular Medicine, Germany

# Our mission was?

To learn some basics of genomics, genetics and R programming by studing how genetic background of lactose intolerance, handedness, speech and language comprehension capabilities and cognitive function changed over time and as humans evolved. We compared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genomes of people who lived during 6000 BC to today. Besides humans, we also analyzed genotypes of chimpanzees, orangutans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. 


# Our results were:

## About author

Inga Patarcic is a PhD Student at Berlin’s Institute for Molecular Systems Biology (BIMSB) in the Bioinformatics and Omics Data Science Group. Her major focus of research is gene regulation, disease biology and machine learning.  She is an author and initiator of the [myDNA R package](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNAS), [shiny app](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNA_shinyApp) and this blog. Previously, she worked in the field of population genetics (University of Zagreb, Croatia) , ancient DNA (University of Split, Croatia), biomedicine (University of Edinburgh, UK), and biospeleology (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). She is an active storyteller, science educator, and passionate climber.
