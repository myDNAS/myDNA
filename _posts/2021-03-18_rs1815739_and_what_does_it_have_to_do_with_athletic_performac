In this post, I will briefly introduce:

1. genetic background of athletic performance

2. rs1815739

  
<br />

# IDEA 

Athletic performance as a phenotype occurs in multiple genetic tests: for example, it was present in the initial versions of 23andMe reports (like 10 years ago) and I recently stumble upon it in the Genomapp (https://genomapp.com/en/)
This test was based on the single SNP: rs1815739 and that made me wonder...
This association was published cca. 14 years ago and is it still valid?
Are there new associations with athletic performance reported or not?
Do people only c/p each others tests without actually investigating the scientific information behind it?

# MY CONTRIBUTION - myDNA R package

Two years ago, I purchased myHeritage DTC test. Since, I received only my ancestry estimations, I decide to read my own genome as bioinformatician by training. I decided to write reproducible R code and create myDNA package. This package enables you to import your genotypes in R, overlap them with GWAS Catalog and identify risk alleles. It also contains small tests that can directly identify SNPs that are associated with oligogenic traits such as lactose intolerance.


Meanwhile, I 
wrote an [myDNA R package](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNAS), 
developed [minimal myDNA shinyApp](https://github.com/IngaPa/myDNA_shinyApp),
started myDNA blog. 
was a project leader at S3++ and educated high-school students genetics, genomics and programming: Analyze myDNA, Internet meets the Human Genome. Analysis of genomes of ancient people reported
